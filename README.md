## 📊 SQL Subqueries & Aggregations – Student Score Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of **SQL subqueries** and **aggregate functions** to analyze student performance data stored in a `Students` table. It includes calculating total scores, filtering based on conditions, and using subqueries for advanced insights.

### 🚀 What’s Included:

* **Database setup** with a `Students` table including Math, Science, and English scores.
* **Data insertion** of 10 sample students with varying score distributions.
* **Computed total scores** using subqueries for each student.
* **Top performer analysis**:

  * Sorted student list by total score (Top 5).
* **Average calculations using subqueries**:

  * Average Math score for students scoring above 70.
  * Average total score for students whose total lies between 200–250.
* **Subquery-based filtering**:

  * Identifying the **second-highest Math score** by excluding the highest value.

### 🛠️ Technologies:

* MySQL / MariaDB
* Subqueries
* Aggregate functions (`AVG()`, `MAX()`)
* Conditional filtering with `WHERE` and `BETWEEN`
